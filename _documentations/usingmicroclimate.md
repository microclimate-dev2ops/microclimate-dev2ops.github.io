## Using Microclimate

After you install Microclimate and use it for the first time, accept the [license agreement](license). You can then begin to work with projects.

Introduction to the Microclimate user interface in Microclimate Version 18.08.

You can use Microclimate to [create a new project](creatingaproject) or [import an existing one](importingaproject). Projects appear in the [project list](projectview). You can [check the application status and build status](checkingstatuses) of your application.

You can then [edit your code](edityourcode) by using the Theia development environment, or you can choose a [development environment of your own](settingownide). Now, when you make a change to your project, Microclimate detects the change and automatically rebuilds and redeploys the updated project for testing. You can also [performance test your project](performancetesting).

If you have many projects on the go at the same time, you can focus resources on those you are currently developing by [disabling development on others](disabledevelopmentonprojects).

## Deploying projects

Finally, when your project is ready to deploy, you can use Microclimate to [create a pipeline](usingapipeline). Having created a pipeline, you can then deploy to IBM Cloud Private, or you can [configure Microclimate to deploy applications to the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](configiks).

## What next
Develop a project of your own, or explore Microclimate with [tutorials and samples](tutorials-and-samples).
