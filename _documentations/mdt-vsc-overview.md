# Microclimate Developer Tools for Visual Studio Code

{% include docs-video.html src="https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/tjcpshqlf5c9ts03m3n43fdv3ulatled.mp4" description="Developing and debugging applications with Microclimate Developer Tools for VS Code" %}

You can use [Microclimate Developer Tools for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.microclimate-tools) to develop your Microclimate projects from within VS Code. Use the tools to access Microclimate features in the comfort of your IDE.

Write code, track application and build statuses, view project logs, and run your application, taking advantage of Microclimate features for [iterative development](https://microclimate-dev2ops.github.io/about#iterative-development). These features are supported for all Microclimate projects. In addition, the tools provide an easy workflow for debugging your Microprofile, Spring, and Node.js applications within the application Docker container.

**Note:** The tools work with only a local installation of Microclimate Version 18.12 or later. Microclimate versions that run on [IBM Cloud Private](https://microclimate-dev2ops.github.io/about#ibm-cloud-private) are not supported. However, you can push projects that you developed with the tools to a Git repository and then deploy them to IBM Cloud Private with the [Microclimate pipeline](usingapipeline).

The VS Code tools [are open source](https://github.com/microclimate-dev2ops/microclimate-vscode-tools). You can browse the code, open issues, and contribute.
