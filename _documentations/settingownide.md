# Working with Microclimate from your editor

Microclimate includes the powerful Theia IDE with extended capabilities, such as [language servers](http://langserver.org) that include our very own [XML Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.XMLLanguageSupport).

With local installations of Microclimate, you can use your text editor or IDE of choice in addition to Theia. Microclimate automatically monitors your project files and detects changes regardless of how you modify the files. For the best developer experience, Microclimate provides plug-ins for both [Eclipse](mdteclipseoverview) and [Visual Studio Code](mdt-vsc-overview), which integrate Microclimate features directly into your IDE.

## Need help?
