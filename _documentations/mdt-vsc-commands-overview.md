# Commands overview: Microclimate Developer Tools for VS Code

All commands provided by this extension are available in the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette). You can also right-click the Microclimate view to invoke most commands with the context menu. The commands differ for connections and projects.

Commands can be enabled for Microclimate connections, projects, or both. Run a command from the Command Palette to view a list of connections and projects on which you can run the command. Additionally, the list might be filtered depending on the command. For example, the **Disable project** command runs only on projects that are **Enabled**.

Commands are separated into categories. See the following pages:
- [Connection commands](mdt-vsc-commands-connection)
- [Project commands](mdt-vsc-commands-project)
- [Restart and debug](mdt-vsc-commands-restart-and-debug)
