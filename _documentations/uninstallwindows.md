# Uninstalling Microclimate on Windows

To uninstall Microclimate on Windows:

1. Stop Microclimate. This stops the Docker containers:
```bash
mcdev stop
```
2. Delete the Microclimate Docker images:
```bash
mcdev delete
```
3. If you plan to [reinstall Microclimate](installlocally) after you uninstall it, such as to update to a newer version, copy your `microclimate-workspace` directory to avoid losing your existing projects. When you're ready to install again, paste the copied directory into the new installation directory before you run the `cli\install.ps1` command for the new installation.
4. Delete the Microclimate directory and its subdirectories:
```bash
rmdir  <microclimate directory> /S
```
5. Delete the `.idc` directory from the `microclimate-workspace` directory.
