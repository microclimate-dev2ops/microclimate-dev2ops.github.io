# Creating a personal access token in GitLab

To create a personal access token for Jenkins to access the microservice projects in GitLab:

1. In a web browser, log in to GitLab with the user account that Jenkins needs to access GitLab. Typically, this is a system or build identity, but can be your personal account for testing purposes.
2. Access your personal settings by clicking on your user icon, and then click **Settings**.
3. Click **Access Tokens**.
4. Give the Token a name that describes the purpose of the token.
6. Add the `api` scope.
7. Click **Create personal access token**, and leave the window open.
8. **Important:** Copy and save your token. You have access only once to the GitLab personal access token.
