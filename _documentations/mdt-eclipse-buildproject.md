# Building Microclimate projects

By default, Microclimate detects when you make a change and starts a build automatically. However, two exceptions exist:

1. If you have disabled auto build for the project.
2. If you are using Windows.

In these cases, start a build manually when you have made a change or a set of changes:

1. Right-click your project in the **Microclimate Explorer** view and select **Build**.
2. Wait for the project state to return to **Running** or **Debugging** in the **Microclimate Explorer** view and then test your changes.
