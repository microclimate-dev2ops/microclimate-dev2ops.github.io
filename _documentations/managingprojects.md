## Managing projects

The project list page contains a listing of all the projects in your Microclimate workspace, and you can use this page to determine the status of your applications.

To view the project list page, in the Microclimate header, click **Projects**. You must have first created or imported a project to see this page.

To view details about a particular project, click the project name. Clicking the shortcut menu alongside a project name also gives you the same options. In addition, there is a `Delete project` option on the shortcut menu that enables you to delete your project.

Both clicking the project name, or using the shortcut menu, take you to the project view for the option you choose. For more information about the project view, see [Using the project view](projectview).
