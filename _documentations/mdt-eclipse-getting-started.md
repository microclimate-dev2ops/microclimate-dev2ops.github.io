# Getting started with Microclimate Developer Tools for Eclipse

Microclimate Developer Tools for Eclipse enables you to develop and debug your Microclimate projects from within Eclipse (debug is only supported for Microprofile/JEE and Spring projects).

The following steps give you an overview of using Microclimate Developer Tools for Eclipse. For more detailed instructions, start with [Installing Microclimate Developer Tools for Eclipse](mdteclipseinstall):

1. Install and start a local Microclimate instance. [Microclimate version 18.12 or later](https://microclimate-dev2ops.github.io/installlocally) is required.

2. Create new projects or import existing projects into Microclimate using the Microclimate UI. Microclimate Developer Tools do not support project creation or import.

3. On an installation of [Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers version 4.8 (Photon) or later](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/), install Microclimate Developer Tools from the [Eclipse Marketplace Microclimate Developer Tools website](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/microclimate-developer-tools).

4. To create a new connection, from the **File** menu select **New** > **Other** > **Microclimate** > **New Microclimate Connection**:
