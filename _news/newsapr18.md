# April updates

## Microclimate 18.04

*Monday, April 30th, 2018*

We are getting our groove on and have put out the Microclimate 18.04 release, which has a few new features. More importantly, we have been doing some work behind the scenes to make our code more robust and clean.

One of the key features we added was the ability to use Microclimate running locally on your machine to create a pipeline running on IBM Cloud Private that can deploy your app. In addition, we added ANSI format support for log files so that we can leverage colors and effects.

We continue to work on new features that we think will make your life easier. But if there are things we are missing out on, please feel free to hit our [Community](./community) page so you can let us know!
