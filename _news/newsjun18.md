## June updates
## Microclimate 18.06

*Friday, 29 June, 2018*

Summer is here, the temperature outside is definitely rising, and we're on the up as we release another fresh version of Microclimate. With this release, we've added a bunch of new features, and we've also continued the good work under the covers improving Microclimate's foundations. The following list features updates for the Microclimate 18.06 release:

- You can now install Microclimate into a non-default namespace.

- For the pipeline, you can deploy to the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS), and create deployments from specific builds of a given project.

- We've created multi-user support in IBM Cloud Private, which means that different users can log in to Microclimate and have different workspaces.

- For a better user experience and to save those finite computing resources, you can now enable and disable automatic builds, and you can also enable and disable entire projects. Disabling a project basically puts your application on a shelf, and allows us to remove all the overhead required to manage that particular application container while you aren't working on it.

- We've improved the build and application status so you can see at a glance what's going on.

- Finally, last but definitely not least, we've improved project validation on import. Wow!

As always, we encourage you to pick up this latest update. We continue to drop code into Microclimate to add more value and improve on the overall quality and development experience. We would also really like to hear from you about any key function you would like to see that we might have not delivered yet, so swing by our [Community](./community) page and share your thoughts and ideas!
