# Microclimate Developer Tools overview
*Friday 08 February 2019*

Do you want to experience the power of Microclimate from your favorite integrated development environment (IDE)? Try out the new Microclimate plug-in for Eclipse or the new Microclimate extension for VS Code. Both provide most of the function that you get in the Microclimate UI, such as opening the application in a browser, automatically building when you save changes to a file, and viewing the application and build logs. They also include useful features beyond what the Microclimate UI provides, including support for debugging your application and support for opening a shell into your application container.

## Microclimate Developer Tools has the following features:
- View all of your Microclimate projects annotated with the current application and build status.
- Open the application or application monitor in a browser.
- Display the application and build logs.
- Import your application into the Eclipse workspace or open your application folder in VS Code.
- Toggle the project automatic build setting and manually initiate project builds.
- Debug Microprofile/Java EE and Spring applications.
- Debug Node.js applications. (This feature is available only in VS Code.)
- Open a shell session into the Docker container for your application.
- Builds run automatically whenever you save changes to files.
- Microclimate validation errors and warnings are integrated into the tools.
