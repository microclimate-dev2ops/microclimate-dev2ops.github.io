# February updates

## Microclimate 19.02

*Friday 08 February 2019*

#### The following list shows updates for the Microclimate 19.02 release:
- Microclimate is now available as an IBM Cloud Pak. This means that you can rely on a trusted and tested release with all the key components verified as a set. For more information, see [https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak).
- Support for IBM Cloud Private 3.1.2.
- In Microclimate Developer Tools for Eclipse, you can restart Node.js projects in debug mode, and the tools help you set up a debug session in a Chromium based browser. For more information, see [Debugging Microclimate Projects](mdteclipsedebugproject).
- In Microclimate Developer Tools for VS Code, we've fixed a couple of bugs. For more information, see the [VS Code tools GitHub repository change history](https://github.com/microclimate-dev2ops/microclimate-vscode-tools/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
- When editing your code in Theia, you can use the Microclimate Node.js Profiling Language Server to provide code highlighting. Code highlighting displays relative time spent in JavaScript functions based on profiling data gathered through Microclimate Load Testing.
