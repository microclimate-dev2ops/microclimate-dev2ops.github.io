# Welcome to Microclimate!
Microclimate is a development environment that equips you to create and modernize applications in one seamless experience. Every Microclimate project is set to react to changes immediately, regardless of language, Docker, or your IDE. From writing and testing code locally to building and deployment with a pipeline, Microclimate is ready for action.

If you're new to microservices, Microclimate is a great place to start learning. Our product automates tasks, such as creating the development environment. It also downloads the runtime and build tools that you need to begin working. You don't need to know everything about every area of microservices; you can focus on the applications of your own.

Microclimate applications are fully contained inside Docker containers throughout the development process. Lightweight containers are easily reproducible to match your production environment. Plus, a containerized environment looks the same when you deploy it to the cloud even if you develop and test locally.

With a Kubernetes deployment of Microclimate, you can access a seamless and configurable end-to-end environment from development to deployment. You also have cluster computing advantages, including cluster storage for local or non-committed code and built-in logging.

Microclimate includes the powerful Theia IDE. We’ve extended its capabilities by putting language servers in the image as well as our own XML Language Support. But if you don't want to use a web-based IDE, we've also made your project ready for rapid development with any popular IDE, including Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, and Atom. Point your IDE at the project, and it’s ready to go!

But automation isn't the only way Microclimate helps you save time. Our product is designed to maximize the efficiency of the development inner loop: Code. Build. Deploy. Run. If one step is slow, it delays the rest. But with Microclimate, each step takes only a bare minimum of time thanks to Docker and Kubernetes strategies applied to our supported runtimes. Round-tripping through edit, build, and run allows real-time performance insights, regardless of what development phase you’re in.

Besides helping you save time, Microclimate also offers choices. You can download and start with a free local installation, or you can install it on IBM Cloud Private. Create and import projects in a variety of development languages, including Java, Node.js, and Swift, or you can add your own by importing a template.
